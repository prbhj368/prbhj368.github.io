        <p> Our cultural odyssey begins in Paris, the City of Lights, where iconic landmarks like the Louvre 
            Museum and the Eiffel Tower stand as testaments to centuries of artistic and architectural brilliance. 
            Dive into the Louvre's vast  collection, home to the enigmatic Mona Lisa and the regal Venus de Milo.

            summit, a panoramic vista awaits, inviting you to savor the skyline during the day or bask in the sparkling city 
            lights after sunset.<br>
            
            Capturing Timeless Moments:
            The Eiffel Tower is not just a spectacle to behold; it's a canvas for creating timeless memories. Whether it's a 
            romantic picnic in the Champ de Mars, a whimsical carousel ride, or a serene Seine River cruise at its base, the 
            Eiffel Tower serves as the backdrop to countless stories of love and exploration.<br>
    
            It was one of my dream destinations. I was feeling significantly haapy while around the eiffel tower. no wonder it 
            is one of the seven wonders of the world.

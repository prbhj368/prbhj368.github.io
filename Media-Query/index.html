  is the birthplace of the Hindu deity Rama of Kosala and setting of the great epic 
  Ramayana and its many versions. </p>

  Owing to the belief as the birthplace of Rama,
  Ayodhya has been regarded as the first of the seven most important pilgrimage sites for Hindus.
 It is believed that a temple stood at the supposed birth spot of Rama</p>
